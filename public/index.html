            <p>My name is Joshua N. Ruiz and I am a computer scientist. I received my degree
                from the City University of New York in May of 2019. I aspire to become an established software 
                engineer with a focus on full-stack and mobile development.<br/><br/>
                I have a varied range of interests, but my primary interests revolve around software development, music production
                and studying.
